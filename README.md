# Advent Of Code

Solutions to the Advent Of Code event.

Each solution is in c++, and the following libraries were used to code the solution:

* fmt
* range-v3
* nlohmann_json
* CryptoPP

The libraries are installed through Conan and solutions are built with CMake.

To run all the solutions run `./run_all_solutions.sh` after compiling them.
